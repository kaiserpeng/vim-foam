# Introduction

This is a filetype plugin for OpenFOAM. It is currently pre-alpha, and the
development will be sporadic. The initial goal is to get up to par with
[vimExtensionOpenFOAM](https://bitbucket.org/shor-ty/vimextensionopenfoam.git).

# Acknowledgements

The syntax part of this plugin is inspired by `vimExtensionOpenFOAM` which was
written by _Ferdinand Leinbach_ and _Tobias Holzmann_.
